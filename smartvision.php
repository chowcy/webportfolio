			<h3>SmartVision</h3>
			<h4>UX Design. Prototyping. App Development.</h4>
			<p>(ongoing) mobile app design/dev for low-vision people.</p>
		</section>

			<h3>Problem and Goal Statement</h3>
				<p>SmartVision is a smartphone application that aims to improve low-vision patientsâ€™ lives, especially those who suffer from central vision loss, by being a relatively inexpensive, portable, and multifunctional magnifying tool.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="portfolio-section">
			<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
				<p>In order to best help low vision people, my team conducted a competitive analysis with other smartphone applications to decide what features we should focus on designing and implementing.</p>

				<p>Parameters included: price, operating system, ratings, presence of filters, ads, gestures, etc.</p>

		<section class="portfolio-section">
			<h3>Interaction Map</h3>
				<p>I then selected one application and mapped the different interactions in the app, so that I could understand the information architecture and interactions.</p>

			<h3>Sketches</h3>
				<p>Next, I drew some sketches to brainstorm what gestures and interfaces would be appropriate for each feature we were interested in implementing.</p>

			<h3>Next Steps</h3>
				<p>I am currently working on the digital prototype of the application on Invision and Marvel App. The prototype can then be tested with low vision users before we move on with the implementation and coding. </p>
