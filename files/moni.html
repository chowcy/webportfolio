		<h1>“Moni Paints a Masterpiece” by Michael Ende</h1>
		<p>Moni and I are the best friends you could possibly imagine. Although she’s only six and I’m about ten times older, the age difference never really matters that much to us.</p>
		<p>Whenever she comes to visit me, we play together without ever arguing. Or we just talk to each other and share our views on life and the world, which we always agree on anyway.  Or we read our favorite books out loud to each other. It’s never a problem that Moni can’t read yet, mainly because she pretty much knows her favorite book by heart and so do I. We have the greatest respect for one another: I for her because she has such remarkably unusual ideas and she for me because I always appreciate her ideas.</p>
		<p>Sometimes we give each other little gifts, even when there’s no special occasion like a birthday or Christmas or anything like that. As the German saying goes: “Little gifts keep friendships strong.” Both of us really take this saying to heart.</p> 
		<p>For example, I recently gave Moni a paint set with many pretty colors, along with paper and a paintbrush.</p>
		<p>Moni was very happy, and I was happy that she was happy. That’s how it usually is with us.</p>
		<p>“Thanks,” she said. “I’m going to give you something too. I’m going to paint you a pretty picture right now.”</p>
		<p>“Oh,” I answered, “really?  That’s so nice of you.”</p>
		<p>“What kind of picture would you like?” she wanted to know.</p>
		<p>I thought about it. “Preferably,” I said, “it would be a surprise. Something that you thought up all by yourself.”</p>
		<p>“Good,” she said, and then she got started right away.</p>
		<p>The tip of her tongue was almost touching her nostrils out of excitement as I watched her eagerly. I was extremely curious to see what would come to her mind this time.</p>
		<p>After a little while, the piece seemed to be completely done. She tilted her head and touched up some parts here and there with her brush before finally sliding the picture to me over the desk.</p>
		<p>“So?” she asked expectantly. “What do you think?”</p>
		<p>“Outstanding,” I answered. “Thank you very much!”</p>
		<p>“So do you know what it is?”</p>
		<p>“Of course,” I hurried to assure her. “It’s an Easter bunny.”</p>
		<p>“Nonsense!” Moni said just a little bit angrily. “It’s still the middle of the summer. Where would an Easter bunny come from?”</p>
		<p>“I thought,” I murmured somewhat quietly, “these two lines over here that are sticking out could maybe be the ears.”</p>
		<p>Moni shook her head. “Those are my braids! It’s a self-portrait of me, don’t you see?”</p>
		<p>“Ah, it must be my glasses.” I apologized and cleaned the lenses with my handkerchief. After I had put them back on, I looked at the painting more closely.  “Of course! Now I can see it all clearly,” I said, “and this self-portrait even looks exactly like you. Anyone would recognize you right away. Sorry about that.” </p>
		<p>“I thought it might even be better than a photo.”</p>
		<p>“Much better,” I agreed.</p>
		<p>“After all, everybody owns a photo,” she continued.</p>
		<p>“Right, that’s nothing special,” I confirmed. “But the self-portrait of an artist? Very few people own one of those – maybe one out of a million people. This is something rare. Thank you again.” </p>
		<p>For a while, we examined the picture together.</p>
		<p>“If you think there’s anything wrong with it,” Moni said generously, “then just go ahead and say it.”</p>
		<p>“Nothing’s wrong at all,” I assured her, “what an odd thought! But since you asked for suggestions yourself,  I guess I find it a little bit unsettling that you are floating in the air in the picture. Couldn’t maybe a bed be painted underneath where you are so that you’re a bit more comfortable? Just my opinion though.”</p>
		<p>Wordlessly, she brought the page over to herself again, grabbed her paintbrush once more, and painted an enormous wooden bedframe around her self-portrait with brown paint. The bed had a tall bedpost at all four corners and up top, there was a canopy. It was a canopy bed – even a queen couldn’t have hoped for anything more beautiful. And it was so big that it filled up the entire paper.</p>
		<p>“By golly!” I said appreciatively. “That’s what I call a piece of royal furniture.”</p>
		<p>But now, the figure lying in the bed was definitely looking a bit small and sad, almost miserable. I didn’t say this out loud, but because we often think the same way, Moni came to the same conclusion anyway.</p>
		<p>“Don’t you think also,” she said uncertainly, “I should maybe wear something more splendid so that I fit in?”</p>
		<p>“To be perfectly honest, yes,” I replied. “Such a royal bed needs a royal nightgown to go with it.”</p>
		<p>So, over the figure, Moni painted a very long and very wide nightgown that, if I recognized correctly, seemed to be dotted with golden stars. Now, only her head and the braids were still visible.</p>
		<p>“What do you think now?” she asked.</p>
		<p>“Majestic!” I had to admit. “Really very magnificent! But still, I worry about your health.”</p>
		<p>“Why?”</p>
		<p>“Well now, don’t get me wrong – right now it’s summer so it’s warm enough to sleep like that, but what will you do in winter? Without a blanket at all, I’m afraid you will catch a terrible cold. You should think about that before it’s too late.” </p>
		<p>More than anything, Moni hates being sick and having to swallow medicine. So she took a whole bunch of white paint and painted a giant, thick comforter over her self-portrait, as well as over the luxurious nightgown. Now, only the tips of her braids peeked through.</p>
		<p>“That certainly looks warm,” I said. “I think we can relax now.”</p>
		<p>But Moni wasn’t satisfied yet; another idea had come to her. With dark-blue paint, she painted heavy velvet curtains that hung down from the canopy and that were shut closed. She herself, along with the nightgown and comforter, had disappeared behind them.</p>
		<p>“Whoa!” I cried, astonished. “What’s this?”</p>
		<p>“All I did was close the curtains,” she explained. “That’s what they’re there for.”</p>
		<p>“But of course!” I admitted. “What’s the use of curtains if they’re open? Then there’d be no point in having a canopy bed.”</p>
		<p>“And now,” Moni continued very excitedly, “I click the lights off.” And she painted the entire picture black.</p>
		<p>“Good night,” I murmured instinctively.</p>
		<p>She pushed the finished painting over to me, which was now completely taken over by darkness. “Are you finally satisfied now?” she asked.</p>
		<p>I stared for a while at the blackness and then nodded. “It’s a masterpiece,” I said, “above all, of course, for those who know what’s really in here.”</p></br>

		<p>About Michael Ende:</p>
		<p>Michael Ende is one of the most loved German children’s authors of the 20th century. With delightful stories such as <i class="book-title">Momo</i>, <i class="book-title">Jim Button and Luke the Engine Driver</i>, and his most famous work, <i class="book-title">The Neverending Story</i>, Ende demonstrated his talent for fantastical story-telling and his knack for creating bizarre worlds. Despite the often deep and complex themes in his stories, Ende’s surreal style of writing, combined with his colorful imagination, managed to entertain both children and adults alike. It’s no wonder that his stories continue to be enjoyed today, including <span lang="de">Moni malt ein Meisterwerk</span>, the short story before you. Although this story, unlike many of his others, is not set in a supernatural world, Ende still manages to show – through the lens of an older narrator – that imagination is something that can, and should, be appreciated by people of all ages.</p>
