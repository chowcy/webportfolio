						<h3>Translation Portfolio</h3>
						<p>I have a great deal of experience and passion for translation and languages, having been raised bilingually and studied German in undergrad. I have translated advertisements, press releases, medical research articles, short literature, and so much more! Read on about my translation projects below and check out my list of translation samples. If the item is starred, you can email <a href='mailto:chowcy@umich.edu'>chowcy@umich.edu</a> to view my sample translation of it!</p>

						<h3>Translate-a-thon at the University of Michigan!</h3>
						<p>Every year, the Language Resource Center at the University of Michigan holds a translation marathon called Translate-a-thon, where volunteer translators come together to work on translating projects that have direct impacts on the community.
							For example, the first time I attended, the German team worked on transcribing and translating a handwritten letter from a
							WWII <span lang="de">Theresienstadt</span> Concentration Camp survivor. What an exciting project! I have since participated three times and have had
							so much fun every time. Check out the <a href="https://www.lrc.lsa.umich.edu/translate-a-thon/" hreflang="en" target="_blank">Language Resource Center's Translate-a-thon website</a>! I am featured in one of their videos.</p>

					<h3>Volunteer Translator at the Language Resource Center's Language Bank</h3>
					<p>Since 2013, I have been a volunteer translator for the University of Michigan Language
						Resource Center's Language Bank, which provides free voluntary translation services to
						"non-profit organizations, social justice efforts, and the local community" in particular.
						 <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/lrc/translation/LanguageBank.html" hreflang="en" target="_blank">
						 	Check out the Language Bank's website here!</a> As a Language Bank Volunteer,
						 	I have proofread an article for 350.org and translated a rather hefty medical journal
						 	article for a research team at the University.</p>
