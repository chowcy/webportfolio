			<h3>Free Your Stuff</h3>
			<h4>Interaction Design. Prototyping.</h4>
			<p>(ongoing) design for a mobile app to share resources in the community.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="portfolio-section">
			<h3>Problem and Goal Statement</h3>
				<p>There is a lot of waste in Ann Arbor because many people move in and out. I would like to connect local
					community members needing and wanting resources to those who have them and
					want to get rid of them so that less environmental waste is created.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="portfolio-section">
			<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
				<p>Next, I ran a competitive analysis to see how the problem of unnecessary waste is currently being handled. I compared these solutions by several factors: price/cost, trust/safety, and whether it helps people in need.</p>

			<h3>Personas</h3>
				<p>I created 5 personas with diverse demographics. One was an anti-persona. This helped me step through scenarios as different personas to better understand how my solution could be designed and used.</p>

			<h3>Paper Prototype</h3>
				<p>I made a paper prototype to show the interactions for my app. My next step is to test this paper prototype with users to gain feedback.</p>

			<h3>Next Steps</h3>
				<p>Using the feedback from my paper prototype, I plan to iterate and redesign the paper prototype before creating a digital prototype I can use for user testing.</p>
