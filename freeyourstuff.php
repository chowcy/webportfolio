			<h4>Interaction Design. Prototyping.</h4>
			<p>design for a mobile app to share resources in the community.</p>

			<h3>Problem and Goal Statement</h3>
				<p>There is a lot of waste in Ann Arbor because so many people move in and out. Local
					community members needing and wanting resources should be connected to those who have them and
					want to get rid of them so that less environmental waste is created.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="portfolio-section">
			<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
				<p>I ran a competitive analysis to see how the problem of unnecessary waste is currently being handled. I compared these solutions by several factors: price/cost, trust/safety, and whether it helps people in need.</p>

			<h3>Personas</h3>
				<p>I created 5 personas with diverse demographics. One was an anti-persona. This helped me step through scenarios as different personas to better understand how my solution could be designed and used.</p>

			<h3>Digital Prototype</h3>
				<p>Using the feedback from my paper prototype, I created a mid-to-high fi digital prototype that I then tested with three users.</p>
