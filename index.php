						<h3>About</h3>
							<p>Hello! I am a first-year Master's student specializing in Human-Computer Interaction at the University of Michigan School of Information. Before I started school here, I taught English in Mainz, Germany as part of the Fulbright English Teaching Assistant Program!

							<p>
								I have a specific interest in designs that are accessible regardless of ability, language, and device. (I am still learning!) My secondary academic interests include programming, translation, languages, psychology, biology, and statistics. Everything is interesting so let's not limit ourselves :)
